Task 1: Preventing Collision Attacks on Hash Functions

Problem: write the problem
Solution: write the solution
Questions to answer:
1.	Why is SHA-1 not secure for digital signatures?
2.  What attack makes SHA-1 unsuitable for cryptographic security?
3.  Replace SHA-1 with a more secure alternative and explain why.

Task 2: The Necessity of Hashing the Message

Problem: write the problem
Solution: write the solution
Questions to answer:
1.  Why is hashing necessary before signing a message?
2.  What risks arise if the message is directly converted to an integer instead of hashed?
3.  Modify the code to ensure secure hashing before signing.

Task 3: Improving 'k' Selection for Signature Generation

Problem: write the problem
Solution: write the solution
Questions to answer:
1.  What issue exists in the selection of k?

Task 4: Attaching the Message to the Signature

Problem: write the problem
Solution: write the solution
Questions to answer:
1.  Why should the message be attached to the signature?
2.  How does separating the message and signature create security risks?
3.  Modify the code to return a signed message that includes the original message.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 5: Ensuring Signature Validity Check in verify_signature()

Problem: write the problem
Solution: write the solution
Questions to answer:
1.  What is missing in the validity check of the signature?
2.  Why could this lead to security or verification issues?
3.  Suggest an improved version of the validity check.

Task 6: Comparing ElGamal and RSA Digital Signature

Problem: write the problem
Solution: write the solution
Questions to answer:
1.  What are the key differences between ElGamal and RSA digital signatures?
2.  Given the ElGamal Digital Signature implementation, would it be better to use RSA instead? Justify your answer based on security, efficiency, and computational complexity.
3.  Provide an example use case where ElGamal would be preferable over RSA.
